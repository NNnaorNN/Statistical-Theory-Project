# Sleep Efficiency Analysis

**Naor and Ohad's Statistical Theory Project**

## Description

This project is part of the Statistical Theory course. It involves analyzing sleep efficiency and its relationship with various sleep metrics such as light sleep percentage, deep sleep percentage, and REM sleep percentage. The main goal is to identify potential relationships between those metrics to habits like exercise frequency, caffeine consumption and alcohol consumption. another goal is to understand the distribution of these metrics.

## Contents

The notebook is structured as follows:

- **Introduction:** Overlook on the data, plots of the distributions of the main features.
- **Results:** Presents the main hypothesis, answers it using course tools, supported by tables, figures, and visualizations.
- **Conclusion:** Discusses the conclusions of the analysis.
